## Printing DLL


</div>

### Description

This is a DLL for reporting. PSC is not that good on this subject so I've made it myself and share it here. Well, it's not ready yet, but I'm still working on it and as soon as it is ready, it will print even in Draft Mode(character printing)
 
### More Info
 
There are no input parameters, only compile it on a DLL or OCX or whatever you want.
